# 2021_S1_CS373_Assignment

This repository provides a Python 3 code skeleton for the image processing assignment of CompSci 373 in Semester 1, 2021. 

This assignment will require you to use what we have studied in the image processing lectures to generate a software that detects QR codes in images - a technology that we are using daily when scanning QR codes with the COVID19 tracer app.

You will receive 10 marks for solving the QR code detection problem, and there will be an additional component for 5 marks, where you will extend upon the QR code detection, and write a short reflective report about your extension.
